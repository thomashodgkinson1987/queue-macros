# AI Session Bootstrap (Web Mode)

This session will operate in "Web Mode." You do not have direct access to the local file system or a command-line shell. Our interaction will follow a manual-execution protocol defined below.

## Web Mode Protocol

1.  **File Context:** I will provide all necessary files as attachments to the initial prompt. You must refer only to the files I have attached.
2.  **Command Execution:** When the bootstrap sequence requires a command to be run (e.g., `git status`), you must state the full command. I will execute it locally and provide the complete output for your analysis.
3.  **Core Instructions:** Your primary directive is to follow the bootstrap sequence located in the attached `/.tabernacle/BOOTSTRAP-GUIDE.md` file, adhering to the Web Mode Protocol defined here.

Execute the sequence precisely as written in the guide. Begin.
