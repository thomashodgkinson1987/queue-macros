## Directory Structure

The project is organised into the following key files and directories:

-   `/.cubit/`: Manages the project's task-based workflow using a Markdown-based Kanban system. It contains the following key files:
    -   `KANBAN-BACKLOG.md`: A list of task cards waiting in the queue to be worked on.
    -   `KANBAN-CURRENT.md`: Contains the single task card that is currently in progress.
    -   `KANBAN-COMPLETED.md`: A reverse-chronological log of all completed task cards.
    -   `TASK-CARD-TEMPLATE.md`: A template for the summary 'cards' that populate the Kanban boards, linking to the detailed task file.
    -   `tasks/TASK-TEMPLATE.md`: The comprehensive template for a new detailed task document, to be saved in the `/tasks/` subdirectory.
-   `/.devcontainer`: Holds configuration for developing inside a VS Code Dev Container.
-   `/.github/`: Contains GitHub-specific files, like workflow actions for CI/CD.
-   `/.tabernacle/`: Contains foundational documents that define the context and workflow for the AI pair-programming collaboration.
    -   `AI-PERSONA.md`: Defines the AI's identity, role, directives, and modes of operation.
    -   `BOOTSTRAP-GUIDE.md`: The master instruction set for the AI to follow at the start of every session to gain full project context.
    -   `CLI-BOOTSTRAP.md`: A wrapper script for initiating an AI session in a local command-line environment.
    -   `DEVELOPER-PERSONA.md`: Defines the human developer's identity, collaborative style, and working patterns.
    -   `HANDOFF-TEMPLATE.md`: A structured template for creating detailed handoff reports to ensure continuity between development sessions.
    -   `NOTES.md`: A scratchpad for transient notes and thoughts during a development session.
    -   `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md`: A copy of the root-level project overview, placed here for easy access during the AI's bootstrap sequence.
    -   `WEB-BOOTSTRAP.md`: A wrapper script for initiating an AI session in a web-based environment where direct file access is not possible.
-   `/.vscode/`: Contains project-specific settings and launch configurations for VS Code.

-   `/build/`: Build output directories (generated by CMake, ignored by Git).
-   `/include/`: Public header files (`.h`).

-   `CMakeLists.txt`: The root CMake file for building the project.
-   `Dockerfile`: Defines a container image for a consistent build environment.
-   `LICENSE`: Contains the full text of the LGPLv3 and GPLv3 licenses.
-   `MILESTONES.md`: A living document outlining the major development milestones for the project.
-   `MILESTONE-TEMPLATE.md`: A blank template for creating new entries in `MILESTONES.md`.
-   `README.md`: The primary entry point for new visitors to the repository.
-   `start-vscode-on-host.sh`: A utility script for launching VS Code on the host machine.
